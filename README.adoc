= Mako

Mako is an operating system for 32-bit x86-compatible computers. Among its features are:

- a Linux-compatible ext2 filesystem
- fully virtualized per-process address spaces
- cooperative and pre-emptive multitasking -- multiple processes and mutliple threads per process
- a graphical user interface
- a (mostly) UNIX-compatible C library
- a Lua interpreter
- graphical applications for navigating directories and editing files

Mako is named after the https://marinebio.org/species/shortfin-mako-sharks/isurus-oxyrinchus/[mako shark], the fastest shark in the sea. The shortfin mako shark is classified as an endangered species by the http://www.iucn.org[IUCN] -- learn more about shark conservation https://www.sharktrust.org/shark-conservation[here].

'Mako' is also the name of the fictional source of energy from https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII[Final Fantasy VII].

== Roadmap

TODOs:

- More/better documentation.
- A shell and terminal emulator.
- Port freetype for non-ugly text.
- Fix the build process.
- Other misc. stuff in the code.

Long term goals:

- Full POSIX compliant libc.
- Port a C compiler.
- Better UI.

== Acknowledgements

Mako depends on:

- http://nurd.se/~noname/?section=sdl_picofont[sdl_picofont] to render text
- the http://lua.org[Lua] programming language

I wrote Mako to better understand how operating systems work and learnt a lot of cool stuff in the process. This project would not exist without:

- the https://wiki.osdev.org/[osdev wiki] and the friendly people of the #osdev IRC channel
- https://littleosbook.github.io/[The little book about OS Development]
- the very well-documented source code of http://github.com/klange/toaruos[ToAruOS], https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity[SerenityOS] and many other hobby-OS projects.
