= Mako
Mako is an operating system for 32-bit x86-compatible computers. Among its features are:
- a Linux-compatible ext2 filesystem
- fully virtualized per-process address spaces
- cooperative and pre-emptive multitasking, including support for intra-process threads
- a graphical user interface
- a (mostly) UNIX-compatible C library
- a Lua interpreter
and a deliberate lack of mouse support for maximum efficiency (just kidding, I will eventually write a mouse driver).

Mako is named after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortfin_mako_shark[mako shark].
