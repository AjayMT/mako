= Mako

Mako is an operating system for 32-bit x86-compatible computers. Among its features are:
- a Linux-compatible ext2 filesystem
- fully virtualized per-process address spaces
- cooperative and pre-emptive multitasking, including support for intra-process threads
- a graphical user interface
- a (mostly) UNIX-compatible C library
- a Lua interpreter

and a deliberate lack of mouse support for maximum efficiency (just kidding, I will eventually write a mouse driver).

Mako is named after the https://marinebio.org/species/shortfin-mako-sharks/isurus-oxyrinchus/[mako shark], an endangered predator that is among the fastest (and therefore coolest) animals in the sea. Learn more about shark conservation https://www.sharktrust.org/shark-conservation[here].

'Mako' is also the name of the fictional source of energy from https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII[Final Fantasy VII].

== Acknowledgements

Mako depends on:
- http://nurd.se/~noname/?section=sdl_picofont[sdl_picofont] to render text
- the http://lua.org[Lua] programming language

I wrote Mako to better understand how operating systems work. It would not exist without:
- the https://wiki.osdev.org/[osdev wiki] and the friendly people of the #osdev IRC channel
- https://littleosbook.github.io/[The little book about OS Development]
- the very well-documented source code of http://github.com/klange/toaruos[ToAruOS], https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity[SerenityOS] and many other hobby-OS projects.
