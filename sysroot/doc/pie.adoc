This document describes the interface and functionality of `pie', the Program
Interaction Environment.

== Interface

pie mimics the functionality of a simple terminal emulator. It hosts
interactive text programs, forwarding text input to the program's
standard input file descriptor and reading its standard output and error
descriptors.

The pie window is made of three parts:
- A top bar that displays the path of the running program.
- A text view that displays the output of the running program.
- A bottom bar that displays the current working directory and the pie prompt.

The pie prompt is always in one of two states:
- `%': No program is running.
- `$': A program is running and is accepting input.

== Usage

When no program is running (the prompt is `%'), enter the name of a program or
built-in command (followed by space-separated arguments) to execute it. Programs
located in paths specified in the PATH and APPS_PATH environment variables can
be executed by name; programs located elsewhere can only be executed by specifying
their full paths relative to the current working directory.

When a program is running (the prompt is `$'), enter text to forward to the
program or press ESC to kill it.

pie accepts the following built-in commands:
- `cd [path]': Change the current working directory to `path', or to the home
  directory if no path is specified.
- `clear': Clear the screen.
