This document describes the interface and functionality of `pie', the Program
Interaction Environment.

== Interface

pie mimics the functionality of a simple terminal emulator. It hosts
interactive text-mode programs, forwarding text input to the program's
standard input file descriptor and reading its standard output and error
descriptors.

The pie window is made of three parts:

- A top bar that displays the path of the hosted program.
- A large text view that displays the output of the hosted program.
- A bottom bar that displays the pie prompt.

The pie prompt is always in one of two states:
- `%': No program is running.
- `$': A program is running and is accepting input.

== Usage

When no program is running (the prompt is `%'), enter the path of a program to
execute it or "q" to quit.

When a program is running (the prompt is `$'), enter text to forward to the
program or press ESC to kill it.
