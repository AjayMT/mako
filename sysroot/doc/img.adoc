This document describes the interface and functionality of `img', the PNG Image
Viewer.

== Interface

img displays a single PNG image in its window, and nothing else. The image is
scaled to fit inside the window and is displayed on a black background.

== Usage

img accepts a single command-line argument that specifies the PNG file to display:

  img <filename>

Pressing 'q' will quit img.

Pressing 'o' will open (with dex) the directory containing the displayed file.
