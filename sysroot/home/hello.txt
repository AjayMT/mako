Hello, world!

This is Mako, a small operating system for 32-bit x86-compatible computers.
Mako is a UNIX-like system that features:
- a Linux-compatible ext2 filesystem,
- a Lua interpreter,
- a graphical window-based user interface,
- a directory explorer (`dex'),
- and a text editor (`xed').

You are currently viewing this document in `xed', the eXtended EDitor.
xed is a modal editor -- press [e] to enter edit (`*') mode or [v] to enter
select (`+') mode.

To view the contents of a different file or directory, press [o] in normal
(`-') mode. Opening a directory will launch `dex', the Directory EXplorer.
Pressing [ALT]+[TAB] will change the active window.

More comprehensive documentation on the system and its applications is
available in the `/doc' directory.

Mako is an independent hobbyist project developed for learning and fun, and
will likely always be a work in progress. If you would like to report bugs
or share feedback, please do so here: <http://github.com/AjayMT/mako>.
